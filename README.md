Hello there,

These were my own solutions for the first intensive month to learn Golang (piscine-go with Notredame university & 01-edu).
PLEASE DO NOT COPY ANY SOLUTION!!!! Try to understand the task and solve it on your own. 
This is your objective, to LEARN!
This repo is just for HELP.

I tried to include some explanations. 
If you need further help, please reach out to me: 
Gmail: tala.aunv@gmail.com 
Discord: @talaamm_

Note: you can find the questions here: https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects 
By searching the questions name (which is also the file's name).

Hope you find it useful & helpful :)
